# distract-block
Filter out distractions using the Distract Block Chrome Extension! The pandemic has made it incredibly hard to focus on the tasks at hand as distractions on the web are just a click away. We can help!

Project made for the Hack CEWIT 2021 *Innovating Through the Pandemic* Hackathon.

## Contributors: 
For three of us, this was our absolute first hackathon. It was a trying test of skills and determination. Luckily, we reached our goal in time and produced something that will hopefully be useful to many people.
